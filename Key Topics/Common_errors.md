* When problem says that the loop should stop at list[0], it is easy to overlook when the loop stop at > 0, which doesn't work.
* Practice more loop tracing problems
* System.out.println(things.set(i, "Phone") + " ");
  * Usage of .set() method and what it returns
* Math library functions
  * Math.random() no parameter
    * 0 is inclusive, 1 is exclusive
* FRQ questions
  1. Return the sum of the entires in one-dimensional aray arr
  2. Returns a one-dimensional array in which the entry at index arr. 0 is the maximum value of the array arr and the entry at index 1 is the number of elements in arr.
  3. Return true if the diffeerence between the average value of arr and the highest value of arr is less than or equal to 15; false otherwise
  4. Don't forget to initialize variables
* MCQs
  1. In the expression below, z and y are boolean variables. (x && y) || x. Which of the following always evaluates to the same outcome as the expression above?
       * (a) y
       * (b) x <-- correct
       * (c) !x && y
       * (d) x == y
       * (e) y != x
  2. Which of the following lines of code would properly simulate the rolling of 2 dice?
       * (a) 2 + (int) (Math.random() * 6)
       * (b) 1 + (int) (Math.random() * 6)
       * (c) 2 * (int) (Math.random() * 6)
       * (d) (int) (Math.random() * 6) + (int) (Math.random() * 6)
       * (e) 2 + (int) (Math.random() * 6) + (int) (Math.random() * 6) <-- correct

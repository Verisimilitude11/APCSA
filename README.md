## Exam Info

The AP Computer Science A exam is a three-hour long exam that consists of two sections: a multiple-choice section and a free-response section.

The multiple-choice section is 1 hour and 30 minutes long and consists of 40 questions. It is worth 50% of the total exam score.

The free-response section is 1 hour and 30 minutes long and consists of 4 questions. It is worth 50% of the total exam score.

The multiple-choice section tests students' knowledge of computer science concepts and skills, including programming, data structures, and computer science principles. The questions may be based on short passages or on individual code segments.

The free-response section requires students to write code in response to prompts. This section tests students' ability to design, implement, and debug programs, as well as their ability to use programming concepts and techniques to solve problems.

Both sections of the exam are designed to test students' knowledge and skills at the level of a first-semester college course in computer science.

I encourage you to use these resources to help you review and become familiar with the material covered on the AP Computer Science A exam. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.
